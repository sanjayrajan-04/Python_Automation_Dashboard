# Python Automation Dashboard (Selenium + PyTest + Jenkins)

A small, easy-to-learn automation project intended for interview demo.

## What it contains
- Simple Page Object Model (HomePage, LoginPage)
- Tests written with PyTest (test_homepage.py, test_login.py)
- Driver setup using webdriver-manager (no manual chromedriver download)
- HTML reports generated by pytest-html
- Jenkinsfile to run tests and publish the HTML report

## Quick setup (local)
1. Install Python 3.11+ (or 3.8+)
2. Clone this project and `cd` into it
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # on Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run tests and generate HTML report:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html
   ```
6. Open `reports/report.html` in your browser.

## Jenkins
- Create a pipeline job pointing to this repository.
- Jenkins will run the included `Jenkinsfile`.
- Install "HTML Publisher Plugin" in Jenkins to publish the report.

## Notes for interview
- Code is intentionally small and commented — easy to explain.
- No database required; focus is on Selenium, PyTest, reporting, and CI.
- You can extend this project later to add more pages or data-driven tests.

Happy testing!
